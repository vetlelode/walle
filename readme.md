# Walle

Wall-e is a line following robot based on the GOPiGo3 robototics kit and the raspberry pi camera.
It borrows some of it's logic from: https://github.com/tprlab/pitanq-dev/tree/master/selfdrive/follow_line


# Todo:

1. Make line and angle detection functional
    * Make current implementation not reliant on file reading
2. Make meaningful movement descicions based on point 1
3. Cleanup the structure of the code
4. Bugtest and fix
